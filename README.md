# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# How the script works

plz unzip the raw data and make sure the unzipped files are in the same working directory of the "run_analysis.R" script. 

"run_analysis.R" performs the required analysis in 5 steps. The script can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
